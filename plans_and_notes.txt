upgrade cards - gold only
gold boost?
cards start randomized like maplestory, within Â±5%
you can upgrade them to +8
all upgrades add 3% strength
this way expensive cards with good effects don't have to be upgraded to be good, while cheaper cards with high stats can be just as good because it's easier to upgrade past +1. vanillas will rarely if ever fall off

~200 gold per day on average from daily quests that require 2-3 wins, 30 gold per win, capped at 300, wagering allowed, expected 300 gold per day

games should take 15-20 minutes based on 1 minute per turn and around 10 turns (per player) a game

30 card deck + 3 counters, any number of each card
4 card starting hand, 5 for second player, 7 cards max. draws don't occur when at max (not milled)
Mulligan specific cards like hs
once-per-turn mulligan like duelyst to prevent stalemates and dead opening hands, 
as well as let you get the last few cards of your deck more easily
draw whenever a minion is destroyed or sacrificed
3 trigger-activated counter cards you can use during anybody's turn that start face up on the board at the start of the game
they can be used to tell what your opponent's deck is for mulligan
whenever a creature hits face, you mill a card
first to deck out loses
you can attack anything, all attacks trade damage (unless effect specifies no retaliation)
only 1 combat stat for creatures
monsters have to wait a turn to attack
cards can mill as costs, big creatures require sacrifices
2 creature summons per turn, but only 1 for first turn
any number of spells
spells have permanent downside of having less cards in hand since they don't replace themselves
drawing cards has inherent downsides
spells are rarer than creatures
max 5 creatures on board
0-5 stars for creatures, represents number of sacrifices needed
5 cards per pack, each card individually has 5% chance of being a counter,  25% change of being a spell, 70% chance of being a creature 
15% chance of rare, 25% chance for uncommon, 60% chance for common
cards can be sold for 10 gold for a rare, 6 gold for an uncommon, 3 gold for a common
times 2 for spell, times 6 for counter


NEW STUFF:

add "ATTACK" cards that allow you to attack, make the game mostly spell oriented.
creatures have 4 stats, health/defense, power, intelligence, speed/cunning (utility stat)
creatures can evolve into upgrades of themselves through some in-game mechanic (maybe getting enough stats, maybe an evolve card, not sure)
cards can evolve into different versions (generic evolve, specific evolve that can only be gotten through a specific card, stat based evolve, etc)
don't have to draw the actual evolved versions (more consistency)
evolves shouldn't be mandatory, and should have real cost (for example play a creature or evolve a creature once a turn)
draw whenever a creature dies based on its intelligence (0 to 3 generally, higher for evolved creatures)

creature types (first expansion, average stat distribution (adds up to 24))
actual numbers will be much lower (generally 1-4 for each stat) for starting creatures
these numbers are going to be around what maxed evolutions will have
orcs (11 hp, 9 power, 1 magic, 3 speed) defense tools, lots of equips that gives damage/defense
sidhe (4 hp, 1 power, 12 magic, 7 speed) barriers, fireballs, instant magic, destroy
fey (6 hp, 2 power, 7 magic, 9 speed) traps, utility, stealing, information, discarding
humans (9 hp, 7 power, 2 magic, 5 speed) technology, equips can give effects, still brute force
expansion
penguins? or other swarm (6, 4, 6, 2) stronger abilities, high synergy (plenty of them number-wise), debuffs (icy cold), play extra creatures
elves or other archers/fast warriors (5, 5, 4, 10) cards like 2 might 3 speed, deal your might twice, hybrid cards, shit at start, insane scaling (draw a card every turn)

since faeries will have low health, they need to be able to tank at least a hit or two from orcs to be viable
so magic cards will have to have a good amount of defensive cards, which shows that faeries were the peaceful race that lived amongside orcs who couldn't enter their cities cuz of barriers, but then humans improved their tech and have now destroyed the city barriers and are attacking the faeries
so humans use a mix of all their tools, they're crafty and have good technology and will do anything to win
faeries want to play defensively and win with as little combat as possible, but will attack with spells if they have to
and the two different types of faeries are the spellcasters who will go a bit more offensive
and the tricksters who will use more tricks and cheat

possible effects: attack with int instead of power, return damage whenever opponent attacks you
cards have stat costs and max stat conditions (stats are like mana, refresh to max every turn)

intelligence
    cards cost lots of current int
    you can run out of current int quickly
    gated by current int, but draws a lot
    pay x to deal x rather than scaling, pay 2 to draw 2 (+1 card advantage), pay 5 to search for any spell, etc
    incentivize winning with strategies and macro gameplay, saving cards, etc
    special effects:
    attacks deal max int damage instead of max power (still gated because low max power means can't play many)
    pay 2 draw 1 once a turn
    increase current int by 3 every turn (but not max)
power
    cards have low to no current power costs
    rarely run out, except when using high impact cards, can usually only use one of those per turn
    gated by low card draw and max stats
    pay 5 to destroy 2 random cards in opponent's hand, pay 3 hp to draw 2 (+1 card advantage)
    PAY 1 STRENGTH TO DEAL DAMAGE EQUAL TO REMAINING STRENGTH
    PAY 4 STRENGTH TO DEAL DAMAGE EQUAL TO REMAINING STRENGTH TO ALL ENEMIES
    incentivize playing slowly and winning with stat efficiency and proper card ordering/micro
    special effects:
    deal power damage whenever attacked (for tanks with low power like barbed wire walls)
    pay 2 to attack once a turn
    regenerate 2 hp every turn

speed
    cards have low to medium current speed costs
    may run out when doing a power turn, but not many huge cost cards. even op cards will be kinda cheap
    gated by low card draw and low scaling, but can pull off huge tempo plays
    pay 5 to deal max speed damage, pay 2 to look at top max speed cards and add one to hand, pay 3 to steal an equip
    pay 2 to double all damage dealt by this creature this turn
    incentivize big tempo turns and winning by waiting for the right time to strike
    special effects:
    attacks deal opponent's max power damage instead of your own and can't be avoided
    use speed to pay any costs
    look at top 2 cards and put one on bottom before drawing
mixed
    mixed cards allow for TONS of possibilities, but for simplicity's sake, will be very limited in the original set

equips return to hand when creature dies, but have costs to play (with exceptions)
low cost cards are most essential
creature deck separate from main deck, 3 creatures 3 main deck cards, first player plays a creature from hand and has to end turn
each creature draws you a couple (1-3 for rank 1) cards from main deck, but you can only play 1 creature per turn
first player gets 0.5 card advantage and 0.5 creatures on board (plus some main deck cards), and second player plays first
this also prevents direct attacks
optionally remove main deck draw for first creature if first player is winning too much

coins are win condition, 20 to win, can also be used as costs (for example use coins instead of cost)
each creature gives coins to opponent (the stronger the more coins it gives)
direct attacks give coins equal to damage

BASIC CARDS HAVE NO LIMIT RESTRICTIONS, YOU CAN HAVE 30 ATTACK CARDS OR BASIC CREATURES, RARITIES ABOVE THAT HAVE RESTRICTIONS


LORE:
elves and fairies were peaceful, protected their cities from orcs which were big brutes using magic shields (magic will need shielding effects to be relevant in-game)
humans were a non-factor, but eventually started creating technology and since humans are viscious, they attacked elf/fairy cities
broke their city barriers, so now it's an all out war between elves/fairies and humans, with orcs as side creatures attacking them both
game is like a game between two bases, you destroy their creatures until you get enough "coins", and attacking their base gives coins when they have no creatures left
you can have as many of basic creatures as you want (they're like militia), but only a few named ones and 1 of each legendary
