upgrade cards - gold only
gold boost?
cards start randomized like maplestory, within Â±5%
you can upgrade them to +8
all upgrades add 3% strength
this way expensive cards with good effects don't have to be upgraded to be good, while cheaper cards with high stats can be just as good because it's easier to upgrade past +1. vanillas will rarely if ever fall off

~200 gold per day on average from daily quests that require 2-3 wins, 30 gold per win, capped at 300, wagering allowed, expected 300 gold per day

games should take 15-20 minutes based on 1 minute per turn and around 10 turns (per player) a game

30 card deck + 3 counters, any number of each card
4 card starting hand, 5 for second player, 7 cards max. draws don't occur when at max (not milled)
Mulligan specific cards like hs
once-per-turn mulligan like duelyst to prevent stalemates and dead opening hands, 
as well as let you get the last few cards of your deck more easily
draw whenever a minion is destroyed or sacrificed
3 trigger-activated counter cards you can use during anybody's turn that start face up on the board at the start of the game
they can be used to tell what your opponent's deck is for mulligan
whenever a creature hits face, you mill a card
first to deck out loses
you can attack anything, all attacks trade damage (unless effect specifies no retaliation)
only 1 combat stat for creatures
monsters have to wait a turn to attack
cards can mill as costs, big creatures require sacrifices
2 creature summons per turn, but only 1 for first turn
any number of spells
spells have permanent downside of having less cards in hand since they don't replace themselves
drawing cards has inherent downsides
spells are rarer than creatures
max 5 creatures on board
0-5 stars for creatures, represents number of sacrifices needed
5 cards per pack, each card individually has 5% chance of being a counter,  25% change of being a spell, 70% chance of being a creature 
15% chance of rare, 25% chance for uncommon, 60% chance for common
cards can be sold for 10 gold for a rare, 6 gold for an uncommon, 3 gold for a common
times 2 for spell, times 6 for counter


NEW STUFF:

add "ATTACK" cards that allow you to attack, make the game mostly spell oriented.
creatures have 4 stats, health/defense, power, intelligence, speed/cunning (utility stat)
creatures can evolve into upgrades of themselves through some in-game mechanic (maybe getting enough stats, maybe an evolve card, not sure)
cards can evolve into different versions (generic evolve, specific evolve that can only be gotten through a specific card, stat based evolve, etc)
don't have to draw the actual evolved versions (more consistency)
evolves shouldn't be mandatory, and should have real cost (for example play a creature or evolve a creature once a turn)
draw whenever a creature dies based on its intelligence (0 to 3 generally, higher for evolved creatures)

creature types (first expansion, average stat distribution (adds up to 24))
actual numbers will be much lower (generally 1-4 for each stat) for starting creatures
these numbers are going to be around what maxed evolutions will have
orcs (2 int, 4 speed, 10 hp, 8 power)
fairies (12 int, 6 speed, 4 hp, 1 power)
elves (7 int, 10 speed, 5 hp, 2 power)
humans (5 int, 5 speed, 8 hp, 6 power)

possible effects: attack with int instead of power, return damage whenever opponent attacks you
cards have stat costs and max stat conditions (stats are like mana, refresh to max every turn)

intelligence
    cards cost lots of current int
    you can run out of current int quickly
    gated by current int, but draws a lot
    pay x to deal x rather than scaling, pay 2 to draw 2 (+1 card advantage), pay 5 to search for any spell, etc
    special effects:
    attacks deal max int damage instead of max power (still gated because low max power means can't play many)
    pay 2 draw 1 once a turn
    increase current int by 3 every turn (but not max)
power
    cards have low to no current power costs
    rarely run out, except when using high impact cards, can usually only use one of those per turn
    gated by low card draw and max stats
    pay 1 to deal max power damage, pay 5 to destroy 2 random cards in opponent's hand, pay 3 hp to draw 2 (+1 card advantage)
    special effects:
    deal power damage whenever attacked (for tanks with low power like barbed wire walls)
    pay 2 to attack once a turn
    regenerate 2 hp every turn
speed
    cards have low to medium current speed costs
    may run out when doing a power turn, but not many huge cost cards. even op cards will be kinda cheap
    gated by low card draw and low scaling, but can pull off huge tempo plays
    pay 2 to deal max speed damage, pay 2 to look at top max speed cards and add one to hand, pay 3 to steal an equip
    special effects:
    attacks deal opponent's max power damage instead of your own and can't be avoided
    use speed to pay any costs
    look at top 2 cards and put one on bottom before drawing
mixed
    mixed cards allow for TONS of possibilities, but for simplicity's sake, will be very limited in the original set

equips return to hand when creature dies, but have costs to play (with exceptions)
low cost cards are most essential
start game with 7 cards in hand, first player doesn't draw and "second" player plays a creature from hand before game starts
then first player gets to play cards first, and second play gets 0.5 more cards and 0.5 more creatures on-board (also prevents direct attacks)

coins are win condition, 20 to win, can also be used as costs (for example use coins instead of cost)
each creature gives coins to opponent (the stronger the more coins it gives)
direct attacks give coins equal to damage
