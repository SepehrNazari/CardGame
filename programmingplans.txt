game main loop handles all player inputs and outputs (this is the gui)
game main loop is aware of all actions a player can take (play a card, attack with a card, etc)
if a player takes one of these actions, it sends the command to the server
the server has the Event.py file which sends the functions to the players' computers telling them what to do
the Player class functions are shown via gui
the server also has a copy of each player's Player class
the server pings each player's computer at set intervals to check they are still connected and they have the correct information
if info doesn't match, send the full player objects to the player
